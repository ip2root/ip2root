## Initial access plugin

Name your python file like this `serviceversionvuln.py` ex: `apache2_4_49RCE.py`, create a config file with the same name but ending with `.ini` and place them in the `plugins/initial_access` directory. The config file should follow the following format :

```ini
[DEFAULT]
plugin_name = <name of your plugin>
service = <name of the vulnerable service>
versions = <versions number>
```

The plugin_name should be the exact same as your python file (case sensitive), the service name should be the same as the name returned by nmap (case sensitive), the versions number should have the same format that the one returned by nmap, you can specify mutliple versions numbers.

##Â Privesc plugins
